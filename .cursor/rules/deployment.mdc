# Deployment (GitHub Pages)

## Publishing Source
In repo Settings -> Pages, Source = **GitHub Actions** (not "Deploy from a branch"). Uses `actions/upload-pages-artifact` + `actions/deploy-pages`. Do **not** use `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`.

## Build
`sbt fullLinkJS` outputs to `target/scalajs-opt/` (`main.js`). Workflow assembles `dist/`: main.js, loader.js, generated index.html, CSS.

## Deploy index.html is Generated
The workflow copies `index.html` and replaces the dev scripts block (between `SCRIPTS:DEV` and `SCRIPTS:END` markers) with production scripts from `deploy/prod-scripts.html`. Any change to the local `index.html` `<head>` is automatically picked up; changes to `<script>` tags must be replicated in `deploy/prod-scripts.html`.

## Module Kind
`build.sbt` must use `ModuleKind.ESModule` (not CommonJS). Production loader uses `import { TyrianApp } from './main.js'` which requires real ES module exports.

## Service Worker
- `sw-register.js`: Only registers when `location.hostname !== 'localhost'` (avoids MIME/404 on local dev).
- `sw.js`: Caches HTML, CSS, fetches. Uses `self.skipWaiting()` on install.
- **Cache busting:** `sw.js` contains a `__BUILD_TS__` placeholder. The deploy workflow replaces it with a Unix timestamp (`date +%s`) via `sed`, so every deploy gets a unique `CACHE_NAME` automatically. On activate, old caches are deleted. No manual version bumps needed.

## Workflow Requirements
Deploy job needs permissions: `contents: read`, `pages: write`, `id-token: write`. Use concurrency group `"pages"` to avoid overlapping deploys.
